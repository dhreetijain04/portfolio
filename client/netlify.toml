# Environment variables for production
# Note: Projects and profile data are included as static fallback in the frontend
# so the site works even without a backend API (perfect for Netlify static hosting)
# Optional: Set these in Netlify dashboard if you want to use a separate backend:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL = your production backend URL
# VITE_API_URL = your production API URL
