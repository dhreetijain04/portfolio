# Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Vite v7.1.9 requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+, but we were using 20.17.0
- **Solution**: Updated to Node.js 20.19.0 across all configuration files

### 2. **Build Directory Configuration**
- **Problem**: Netlify expected `build` directory but Vite was outputting to `dist`
- **Solution**: Updated Vite config to output to `build` directory

### 3. **Netlify Configuration Path**
- **Problem**: Incorrect publish path in netlify.toml
- **Solution**: Fixed relative path from `client/build/` to `build/` (relative to base directory)

## 📁 Files Updated

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `.nvmrc` → `20.19.0`
- ✅ `client/.nvmrc` → `20.19.0`
- ✅ `client/package.json` → engines.node: `>=20.19.0`
- ✅ `client/netlify.toml` → NODE_VERSION: `20.19.0`, publish: `build/`
- ✅ `client/vite.config.js` → outDir: `build`

### Build Verification
- ✅ Local build successful
- ✅ Output directory: `client/build/`
- ✅ All assets properly generated
- ✅ Build size optimized (gzipped: ~78KB total)
