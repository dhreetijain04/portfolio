# Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Vite Configuration Status

### Step 2: Vite Configuration ✓
- **Base path**: Correctly set to `"/"` for Netlify
- **Plugins**: `@vitejs/plugin-react` properly installed and imported
- **Build target**: Set to `esnext` for modern browsers
- **Host configuration**: Added `host: true` for external connections
- **Asset optimization**: Proper chunk splitting and caching

### Step 3: Dependencies ✓
All dependencies are correctly configured:

**Production Dependencies (dependencies):**
- `react@18.3.1` ✓
- `react-dom@18.3.1` ✓
- `react-router-dom@6.30.1` ✓
- `axios@1.5.0` ✓

**Development Dependencies (devDependencies):**
- `vite@7.1.9` ✓ (correctly in devDependencies)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react@4.0.3` ✓
- `terser@5.44.0` ✓ (for minification)

## 🚀 Netlify Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Quick)
1. Run `npm run build` in the client folder
2. Drag the `client/dist/` folder to Netlify dashboard

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `client/dist`
   - **Base directory**: `client`

### Environment Variables in Netlify
Set these in your Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.render.com
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.render.com/api
```

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

### ✅ Configuration Files
- `client/vite.config.js` - Updated for Netlify compatibility
- `client/netlify.toml` - Netlify-specific configuration
- `client/.env.example` - Environment variable template

### 🔧 Build Verification
- Build tested successfully ✓
- Output size optimized with chunk splitting
- All assets properly bundled

## 🌐 Production Checklist

- [ ] Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render/Railway first
- [ ] Update VITE_BACKEND_URL with production backend URL
- [ ] Test contact form with production backend
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Check that routing works (SPA redirects configured)

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

The Netlify configuration includes:
- SPA routing support (/* redirects to /index.html)
- Security headers (XSS protection, frame options, etc.)
- Asset caching (1 year for immutable assets)
- Gzip compression enabled automatically
